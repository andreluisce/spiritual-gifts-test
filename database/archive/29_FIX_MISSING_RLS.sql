-- =========================================================
-- SUMMARY OF SECURITY POLICIES APPLIED:
-- =========================================================
-- All tables now have RLS enabled with read-only policies
-- for authenticated users. This ensures:
-- 
-- 1. Data integrity is maintained
-- 2. No unauthorized modifications
-- 3. Consistent access patterns
-- 4. Future-proof security model
-- 
-- These are reference/lookup tables that should be
-- read-only for application users.
