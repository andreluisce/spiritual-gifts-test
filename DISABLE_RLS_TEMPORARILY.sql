-- DISABLE RLS TEMPORARILY - Execute this to fix the auth.users permission issue
-- This will temporarily disable RLS until we can fix the auth permissions properly

-- 1. Completely disable RLS on quiz tables to allow operations
ALTER TABLE quiz_sessions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE answers DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 2. Drop all problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quiz_sessions_select" ON quiz_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quiz_sessions_insert" ON quiz_sessions; 
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quiz_sessions_update" ON quiz_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "quiz_sessions_delete" ON quiz_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "answers_all" ON answers;

-- 3. Grant full access to authenticated users (since RLS is disabled)
GRANT ALL ON quiz_sessions TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON answers TO authenticated;

-- 4. Also grant to anon in case that's needed
GRANT ALL ON quiz_sessions TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON answers TO anon;

-- 5. Success message
SELECT 'RLS disabled - DELETE should work now. Re-enable RLS later with proper auth permissions.' as status;

-- NOTE: This is a temporary fix. Later we need to:
-- 1. Fix auth.users table permissions
-- 2. Re-enable RLS with proper policies
-- 3. Test thoroughly
